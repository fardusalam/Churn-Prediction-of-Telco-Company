📊 Churn Prediction for Subscription Businesses
This project aims to predict customer churn in a subscription-based business using machine learning. Early identification of customers likely to leave enables businesses to take proactive retention measures and improve overall customer satisfaction.

🚀 Project Overview
Goal:
Build a predictive model that classifies whether a customer will churn based on behavioral and subscription data.

Tech Stack:

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib)

Jupyter Notebook

Machine Learning (Classification)

Power BI / Data Visualization (optional)

Dataset:
A custom dataset with customer attributes such as:

gender, SeniorCitizen, tenure, Contract, MonthlyCharges, etc.

Two added columns: isPremium (Yes/No), and serviceCalls (float)

Model	Accuracy	Precision	Recall	F1 Score
Random Forest	0.86	0.83	0.79	0.81

📌 Key Takeaways
Long-tenure customers and premium users are less likely to churn.

Monthly charges and type of contract play a major role in customer retention.

The model can be integrated into a customer management dashboard for proactive outreach.

📈 Future Improvements
Incorporate time-series or sequential behavior data.

Fine-tune with SMOTE or advanced resampling.

Deploy the model using FastAPI or Streamlit.

Dashboard creation in Power BI or Tableau.
