## Churn Prediction for Subscription Businesses.

This project aims to predict customer churn in a subscription-based business using machine learning. Early identification of customers likely to leave enables businesses to take proactive retention measures and improve overall customer satisfaction.
1. Project Overview
Goal
Build a predictive model that classifies whether a customer will churn based on behavioral and subscription data.
•	Tech Stack

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
1.	Jupyter Notebook
2.	Machine Learning (Classification)
3.	Power BI / Data Visualization (optional)

•	Dataset
A custom dataset with customer attributes such as:

•	gender
•	SeniorCitizen
•	tenure
•	Contract
•	MonthlyCharges


3.  Workflow
3.1 Data Preprocessing

•	Handling missing values
•	Encoding categorical variables
•	Feature engineering (isPremium, serviceCalls)

3.2 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

•	Visualizing churn trends
•	Understanding feature distributions

3.3 Modeling

•	Train/Test split
•	Model training (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
•	Evaluation with metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score)

3.4 Interpretation & Insights

•	Feature importance analysis
•	Actionable insights for business decisions

4. Model Performance
(To be updated after completing training)

•	Model
•	Accuracy
•	Precision
•	Recall
•	F1 Score


5. Key Takeaways

•	Long-tenure customers and premium users are less likely to churn.
•	Monthly charges and type of contract play a major role in customer retention.
•	The model can be integrated into a customer management dashboard for proactive outreach.

6. Future Improvements

•	Incorporate time-series or sequential behavior data.
•	Fine-tune with SMOTE or advanced resampling.
•	Deploy the model using FastAPI or Streamlit.
•	Dashboard creation in Power BI or Tableau.
